# 30 Repos

## Create 30 repos (test1-test30). 
- Each of these repos should live here: `~/workspace/foundations/exercises`.  
- DO NOT DO ALL REPOS ON THE SAME DAY. Create a maximum of 5 repos per day.
- Each repo has an issue ticket created for it. As you create your repos, add the link to the issue ticket as a comment and close out the issue ticket.
- Each repo should have:
  * Each repo should start with a README.md file that you push to main branch
  * Each repo should have a setup branch. This branch should have 3 files - `index.html`, `main.css`, and `main.js`. The `index.html` file should have html boilerplate, link to the CSS file, script tag to the JS file. The css file should change the background color.  The JS file should have a `console.log` of your choice
  * There should be PR from the setup branch to the main branch
  * Before you merge the PR - your code should be properly indented and clean (consistent appropriate spacing)
  * Final result for a repo should have everything merged into main
  * If you mess up on one, skip it and move on, adding to your final number of completed repos. i.e. if you mess up test05, move on to test06, and at the end of this end up with test01-test31 pushed up to GitHub, skipping test05 (the one you messed up)
